# My Personal Project: Autocorerct

## What is Autocorect?

- The application, **Autocorerct** is a Java game where the players try to type unordered and randomly scattered letters into one correct spelling of a word, this aims to increase the spelling accuracy of players.
- Players are able to add words that are tested in the game, so the game would be **personalized** to which words you are having difficulty with.

## What else should I know?
Who will use it?
- This project is for anyone aiming to increase typing accuracy while playing a game and having fun. The ideal target is anyone from the ten to forty year old age demographic.


Why is this project of interest to you?
- This project seems simple as essentially it boils down to implementing a way to type and randomly scattering letters, however the code to build these kinds of simple projects is often complex and challenging which allows me to only recall important lecture concepts but also implement concepts in a creative way.
- Creating a game to increase typing accuracy seems interesting as it solves a real problem where digital users often struggle with the spelling of words as they are dependent on autocorrect. Iâ€™m able to solve this problem while packaging it in a fun way, hence the project is interesting. 

## User Stories
Here are several user stories for the project:
- As a user, I want to be able to **add** a new word to a list of words that appear in the game. 
- As a user, I want to be able to **view** a personalized list of words that I have added 
- As a user, I want to be able to **delete** certain words from my personalized list.
- As a user, I want to be able to **view** randomly scattered and unordered letters of a word in a game level. 
- As a user, I want to be able to **play the game** by typing the correct order of letters.
- As a user, I want to be able to **get feedback** on the accuracy of my typing and obtaining a score for every correct spelling of a word.
- As a user, I want to be able to be reminded to **save** the current list of difficult words and choose whether to save or not.
- As a user, I want to be able to **load** a previous list of difficult words when I start the application.
